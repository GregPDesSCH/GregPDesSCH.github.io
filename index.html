            <div>
                I am 23 years old, and I am originally from Montreal, Quebec. I hold a college / associate&#39;s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics after completing three years of college education at Champlain College Saint-Lambert. I am also an alumnus of several schools through the Riverside School Board, one of Quebec&#39;s English language school boards. I started my education through them in 1998 at REACH School in Saint-Lambert and graduated from Heritage Regional High School in June 2011.
            </div>
            <div>
                I have been exposed to programming since Grade 7, when there was a computer science course offered at high school; it let me get some prime exposure to HTML. It was from there that eventually I learned Java when I started attending college. Since then, I got some exposure to CSS, C, C++, Python, jQuery, and Backbone.js.
            </div>
            <div>
                Whenever I am in relax mode, I usually watch a whole bunch of YouTube videos on my laptop. I also have an interest into computer games, as I explicitly mention what games I like below.

                <div>&quot;Curse you, Sephiroth, curse you!!&quot;</div>

                <div><strong>Stay fresh!</strong> - Callie &amp; Marie, Splatoon, 2015 (Nintendo, written by NOA's Localization Team)</div>
                <div>I never would have guessed that such a simple saying in a game I absolutely love would make an impact to the way on how I treat myself. There is a meaning in using it in the game, but I want to give out my interpretation.</div>
                <div>The way on how I resonate it is simple: you need to keep yourself so calm when battling through an intense amount of work and involvement, especially when you want to achieve something in life and fulfill your desires and wishes. Go out there and ask your friends to help you out, because your own self-esteem is a lot more important than just pushing yourself on to be better than someone else.</div>
                <div>You definitely need to get rid of bad habits that stand in your way, because only then will you be able to progress and thus take on this opportunity to learn a lot. In addition, it opens up your mind for some creative ideas, just like the meaning of the word &quot;fresh&quot;, which is being pure and clean.</div>

                I grew up playing various computer games mostly in my time. I also watched numerous television shows, featurettes and movies on VCR and DVD, and felt kind of enthusiastic when going out with my family to museums and attractions.

                My childhood video game console was the Nintendo 64. Aside from having some of the &quot;must-have&quot; games, including Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, and Wave Race 64, because we had a very suitable income, we also went out to rent various games for the console as well, ranging from EA Supercross 2000 to Quake II, from Mario Tennis to South Park, and from MegaMan 64 and PilotWings 64 to Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater. We also did own a PlayStation, but we never went out to rent some of the highlighted games there. In addition, I loved playing various arcade machines, where my shooting favourite was Namco&#39;s Time Crisis II, and my racing favourite was probably Sega Rally 2.

                On the television and cinema side, I was into Star Wars, Pok&eacute;mon, Winnie The Pooh, archived lottery game shows like Family Feud, Jeopardy, and Wheel of Fortune, and several music videos and documentaries. I was also exposed to various movies produced by the Walt Disney Company, such as The Aristocats. Other television shows I was exposed to include Stickin' Around, Uh-Oh!, a few on Teletoon, Cyberchase, ZOOM, Arthur, Postcards from Buster, and even Seven Little Monsters. My own brother was more into Animaniacs.

                Eventually, I went on to check out games for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and done so many look ups on the World Wide Web. I started watching YouTube videos after watching an in-game recording of Namco&#39;s Rave Racer arcade machine in 2006. I was also a user of RuneScape for seven years, where most of the time I was known as Bammer 300. (I really do miss playing that online game. On the other hand, I had to give up playing it because I found out in 2010 that I became incredibly busy it was worthless to keep on spending $7 a month on membership.)

                My interests were so beyond my parents&#39; control. It was only through continuous efforts with my educators and teachers that I was able to get through elementary school, high school, and CEGEP. Because of my performance in mathematics and how I was bonded to computers at the time, I decided to move on to doing mathematics, physics, and computer science.

                What made me get into Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo was that I had a more solid understanding of software development in practice instead of the underlying theories, including those from the Turing machine, and Russel&#39;s paradox. It also had to do with the amount of detail I can get, especially when I focus more on the underlying tasks at hand instead of those in general and abstract. Plus, it had to do with the university's immense co-op program, as it would enable me to build myself up into a software developer.

                I was nervous during my last college term because I knew I would face so much trouble. Yet somehow, with the right support from my professors and my connections, along with encouragement from UWaterloo itself, I was pretty safe.
