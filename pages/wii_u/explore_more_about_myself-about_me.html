                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    I have been exposed to programming since Grade 7, when there was a computer science course offered at high school; it let me get some prime exposure to HTML. It was from there that eventually I learned Java when I started attending college. Since then, I got some exposure to CSS, C, C++, Python, jQuery, and Backbone.js.
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    There are some programming languages that I have an interest in learning. Some of them are not so difficult to grasp, but others can be a pain. For instance, I have interest in learning Intel's x86 Assembly. When I had my first exposure to MIPS Assembly and ARM Assembly in Fall 2015, I knew for sure that it's not so easy to generalize a function or procedure as a list of very micro-level instructions. 
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    Whenever I am in relax mode, I usually watch a whole bunch of YouTube videos on my laptop. I also have an interest into computer games, as I explicitly mention what games I like below.

                    I never would have guessed that such a simple saying in a game I absolutely love would make an impact to the way on how I treat myself. There is a meaning in using it in the game, but I want to give out my interpretation.
                </div>
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    The way on how I resonate it is simple: you need to keep yourself so calm when battling through an intense amount of work and involvement, especially when you want to achieve something in life and fulfill your desires and wishes. Go out there and ask your friends to help you out, because your own self-esteem is a lot more important than just pushing yourself on to be better than someone else.
                </div>
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    You definitely need to get rid of bad habits that stand in your way, because only then will you be able to progress and thus take on this opportunity to learn a lot. In addition, it opens up your mind for some creative ideas, just like the meaning of the word &quot;fresh&quot;, which is being pure and clean.

                    Some of my dreams (and things I want to do):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sounds very difficult to learn and do, but speak and write Japanese, since I think the majority of video games are developed in Japan.</li>
                        <li>Going to video game conventions such as the Electronic Entertainment Expo, MagFest (after finding out that I definitely loved my experience attending the Montreal ComicCon twice!)</li>
                        <li>Organize and host a Splatoon tournament at the University of Waterloo with recognition and promotion from Nintendo of America (as a homage to the company)</li>
                        <li>Cosplaying as one of the characters that I love, such as a Blue Inkling Boy from Splatoon or Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII</li>
                        <li>Spending one full day doing nothing but spending money to play coin-op arcade games, both old and new ones (I got too many specific ones to mention!)</li>
                        <li>Taking a vacation or doing a co-op in NYC to visit some of the attractions such as Central Park</li>
                        <li>Buying a mix of both sedentary and healthy foods from food trucks and push carts</li>
                        <li>Buy tickets to watch a baseball game with the Toronto Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre (as long as I got my phone with me to keep myself busy in case I feel bored)</li>
                        <li>Play some games where I wouldn't take things so seriously and end up being totally discouraged, such as <em>Bad Piggies</em> on the Android.</li>
                        <li>Live more downtown in big cities instead of in the suburbs</li>
                        <li>Host a speech on autism awareness and sharing my personality at the University of Waterloo, with specifically two co-hosts I am thinking of: YouTube user Dieselducy, and Alexis Wineman</li>
                        <li>Try out some activities such as batting cage, illuminated mini-putt, laser tag</li>
                        <li>Take a few tourism and entertainment trips to some places such as Niagara Falls, Orlando, Chicago, Myrtle Beach, Indianapolis, or perhaps New Orleans (known for its traditional Mardis Gras celebration) </li>
                        <li>Learn on some new perpetuating skills so that I can use them in, for example, hackathons, where I take them as an awesome opportunity to add projects to my resume. For instance, developing a stronger sense of pragmatism and thinking outside the box.</li>
                        <li>Buy and play David Braben&#39; <em>Elite: Dangerous</em></li>
                        <li>Visit numerous attractions such as Ripley&#39;s Aquarium of Canada in Toronto, Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, Yellowstone National Park, or perhaps the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington.</li>
                        <li>Understand and learn on how not to take things too seriously so that I can enjoy certain things. The voice generation in Nintendo&#39;s Miitomo is one thing, since I do want to use the app!</li>
                    </ul>
                    This list would keep on going and going, as if I got too many expectations by my side. But isn&#39;t it nice to have some of them and mention them?

                <h3 class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfHeader projectPaintballFontFamily" id="biography"><a href="#topOfPage" class="customLinkStyle">Biography</a></h3>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    I grew up playing various computer games mostly in my time. I also watched numerous television shows, featurettes and movies on VCR and DVD, and felt kind of enthusiastic when going out with my family to museums and attractions. 
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    My childhood video game console was the Nintendo 64. Aside from having some of the &quot;must-have&quot; games, including Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, and Wave Race 64, because we had a very suitable income, we also went out to rent various games for the console as well, ranging from EA Supercross 2000 to Quake II, from Mario Tennis to South Park, and from MegaMan 64 and PilotWings 64 to Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater. We also did own a PlayStation, but we never went out to rent some of the highlighted games there. In addition, I loved playing various arcade machines, where my shooting favourite was Namco&#39;s Time Crisis II, and my racing favourite was probably Sega Rally 2. 
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    On the television and cinema side, I was into Star Wars, Pok&eacute;mon, Winnie The Pooh, archived lottery game shows like Family Feud, Jeopardy, and Wheel of Fortune, and several music videos and documentaries. I was also exposed to various movies produced by the Walt Disney Company, such as The Aristocats. Other television shows I was exposed to include Stickin&#39; Around, Uh-Oh!, a few on Teletoon, Cyberchase, ZOOM, Arthur, Postcards from Buster, and even Seven Little Monsters. My own brother was more into Animaniacs.
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    Eventually, I went on to check out games for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and done so many look ups on the World Wide Web. I started watching YouTube videos after watching an in-game recording of Namco&#39;s Rave Racer arcade machine in 2006. I was also a user of RuneScape for seven years, where most of the time I was known as Bammer 300. (I really do miss playing that online game. On the other hand, I had to give up playing it because I found out in 2010 that I became incredibly busy it was worthless to keep on spending $7 a month on membership.) 
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    My interests were so beyond my parents&#39; control. It was only through continuous efforts with my educators and teachers that I was able to get through elementary school, high school, and CEGEP. Because of my performance in mathematics and how I was bonded to computers at the time, I decided to move on to doing mathematics, physics, and computer science. 
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    What made me get into Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo was that I had a more solid understanding of software development in practice instead of the underlying theories, including those from the Turing machine, and Russel&#39;s paradox. It also had to do with the amount of detail I can get, especially when I focus more on the underlying tasks at hand instead of those in general and abstract. Plus, it had to do with the university&#39;s immense co-op program, as it would enable me to build myself up into a software developer.
                </div>

                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    I was nervous during my last college term because I knew I would face so much trouble. Yet somehow, with the right support from my professors and my connections, along with encouragement from UWaterloo itself, I was pretty safe.
