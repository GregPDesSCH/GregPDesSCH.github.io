        <h2>GitHub Repository</h2>
        <div class="mainText">
            This is where I keep some accessible projects I was involved in. All the files are stored in the GitHub repository &quot;<a class="incorporatedMainTextLinks" href="https://github.com/GregPDesSCH/website-portfolio">GregPDesSCH&frasl;website-portfolio</a>&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>
            
            HOW TO DOWNLOAD: In the repository, click on which file you want, then click on &quot;View Raw.&quot; That file will be downloaded automatically. Some of my projects are compressed as ZIP files, where you'll need an extraction tool to uncompress and open them if the operating system you're using to download the files is not Microsoft Windows. Two examples are WinRAR and 7zip.<br/><br/><br/>
            
            <p class="subHeadings">Caffeine Hunter</p> <br/>
            Only the project report (as a PDF file) is available for download. This holds all the techniques used for implementation, what was the design procedure, what was our progress overtime, and any additional information based on the practices of software engineering.<br/><br/><br/>
            
            <p class="subHeadings">The Desrosiers Mechanics Teaching Tool</p><br/>
            Includes the source code, additional resource files, an about file, a development log, and a 57 page formal report, with UML diagrams, installation instructions, and more.<br/><br/><br/>
            
            
            <p class="subHeadings">AWT Animated Balls</p><br/>
            Includes the source code and an executable file as a JAR file. "Help" and "About" features are encoded in the program for you. However, the source code itself is not commented, and so if you decide to read it, do so at your own risk. <br/><br/><br/>
            
            <p class="subHeadings">Traffic &amp; The River Music Videos Website</p><br/>
            Includes HTML files, one CSS file, an Images directory, and three directories generated by Adobe CS3 Dreamweaver.<br/><br/><br/>
