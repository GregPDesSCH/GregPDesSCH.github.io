<a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2014/12/to-be-successful-or-not-to-be-successful.html">To Be Successful or Not To Be Successful</a><br/><br/>

In reaction to my attempt in passing Software Engineering 1A at UWaterloo, which seemed to be somewhat overwhelmingly stressful semester going in after a summer that I personally find so ridiculous of myself, I wrote this very long blog. I had an understanding of how people can support me after posting the Stand Up to Stigma photo (you know, the one in the Portfolio Page) to several Facebook groups, including the UWaterloo Frosh group.<br/><br/>

            <a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2013/06/java-program-circle-cannon-shooter.html">Java Program: Circle Cannon Shooter</a><br/><br/>

I once tried writing a game as an exercise in Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming (9th Edition) where you had to use the AWT Graphics class and other objects to create a basic game involving a cannon firing pistols to much larger circles. It involved animation, keyboard listeners, randomization, and a GUI by using the Swing library. In my case, what I have here is a version of it where it includes a 60-second timer, a score counter, and a very rough and crude frame effect when a large circle is hit by a smaller circle.<br/><br/>

It isn't a very well-implemented game because of the reality of AWT. However, it was a learning opportunity because after looking on this, I only wish I could do something like this in a more fun environment.<br/><br/>

Example and source code included; you are free to use it and modify it at your convenience. (If you are using JDK 1.8 on your IDE or compiler, you will get numerous warning messages because some of the code is outdated compared to the new version. However, the program still works, as tested on NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 as of March 1st, 2015)<br/><br/><br/><br/>


            
            <a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2013/06/the-asperger-computer-second-edition.html">The Mentally Handicapped Stranger (Short Story)</a><br/><br/>

What initially seemed to be a fun morning for a child to step into a fast-food restaurant for breakfast turns into a situation of selfishness and worry...<br/><br/>

This was a short story I wrote on my own, using several pictures I pulled online as a rough visual for the scene depicted in this story. It was a preview for “The Asperger Computer” released in July 2013.<br/><br/><br/><br/>


            
            <a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2014/06/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-java.html">Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</a><br/><br/>

Influenced by The Big Bang Theory where Sheldon Cooper introduces Rajesh “Raj” Koothrapalli to “Rock-paper-scissors-Lizard-Spock,” I thought I'd do an implementation of my own in Java. I actually did do an implementation like this in UWaterloo's CS 137 as one of the assignment questions as well, but in C. <br/><br/>

The major difference between them is, in my implementation in C, it was a method with multiple if-else-if clauses. Here, it's similar, but I implemented as a program with error management and the ability to play again.<br/><br/>

This is a console-based program; not a single GUI or input event is used except for the pure Scanner class.<br/><br/><br/><br/>


            
            <a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2013/01/elementary-school-graduation-message.html">Elementary School Graduation Message</a><br/><br/>

Because of my parents' original concerns that I was not going to complete elementary school, I decided to post the original graduation message my elementary school principal read to us during the graduation ceremony on June 21, 2006.<br/><br/>

If I'm being too afraid to show off my true colors, as this blog recalls, I won't be true of myself. And things can definitely be unwritten for sure; it's only me who can change them or see them as time flies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
            
            

            <a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2012/10/list-of-played-n64-games.html">List of N64 Games Played</a><br/><br/>
            
I mentioned in my summary in the &quot;About Me&quot; page that my childhood console was the Nintendo 64. This blog holds a list of all the N64 games I've played in my experience. That's not to show my professional candidacy, but more on my passion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
            
            

            <a class="blogLinks" href="http://gregorypdesrosiersmontreal.blogspot.ca/2012/12/longueuil-rtl-83-sec-5-english-short.html">Longueuil RTL &#35;83</a><br/><br/>
Since I happened to be a font family lover, I was compelled at one point to try to get a photo shot of one model of a low-floor bus manufactured by NovaBUS Inc. in Saint-Eustache, Quebec. In this case, it was one of Reseau de transport de Longueuil's buses for a line in my hometown. What I wanted to capture was a photo of the bus with its LED display on top of the windshield showing one of its destinations: Longueuil's bus terminal, or as I prefer to call it that also exists on the headers of those buses, "Terminus Longueuil." (Hmm, doesn't the first word sound like Latin?) That photo alone has driven me crazy so much that I wrote a short story as an assignment submission in Secondary 5 English.<br/><br/>
            
Nowadays, I don't think it's really a pleasant story, because I've only gotten 60% on that assignment alone, with the most general comment being &quot;What is the theme of the story?&quot;.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
