                    I was pretty much into computer games than all of those other childhood activities, whether it was drawing stuff on the driveway or road with chalk, playing baseball or tennis, biking around the block, or having fun at the playground. The real culprit came from when I participated in a summer camp at McGill University in 2010 called &quot;Be A Computer Scientist for A Week.&quot; Even though I took it so seriously and really was so hard on myself I got stressed out at certain points, it made me earn a passion for this that was built through my college education.

                   Building things where the design is more from myself than just having to stick to the design by something else. One habit I had when I was so young is drawing so many things out on paper to replicate sequels of video games; even though I drew mostly user interfaces and not the game environments, I was kind of creative.
                </div>    
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                   I even took some art courses in high school where even though it was kind of hard to understand some things that my teachers were looking for, I would try to design things that looked so catchy beyond the mind&#39;s eye, making sure I kept myself up to what the teachers expected so that I would not break the rules. One of my favourite art assignments was doing this promotion poster of a variety show at my high school to celebrate the end of a school year, where it did took longer than what my teacher expected, but I ended up finishing it anyway because I just wanted to see it finished.

                </h4>
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                   From not doing a lot of research back in 2014, I think Software Engineering simply involves the application of engineering practices to software development. Even though some of the theories I&#39;ve learned in CS were pretty interesting at the time, I feel that it was more valuable for me to take on the side to which I would want to build something creative instead of consistently performing research and identifying what it is we can expand upon in the electronics side.
                </div>    
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                   Even though technically at UWaterloo, Software Engineering is a combination of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science, there are so many realities I would learn along the way that I can apply in my responsibilities when I am in my career. It&#39;s simply applying critical theories while building on this sort of immense amount of code so that customers can have a surprising first reaction and that certain things would be seen as innovative or just some casual practice.

            <!-- Section 4: Software engineering itself is a very broad discipline. What sub-disciplines do you like the most? -->

                </h4>
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    For this, I am taking the theme of this as discussed <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~fahadi/sw.html" class="customLinkStyle">from a page offered by the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</a>
                </div>
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                   It would be software development, because that&#39;s where I can apply both my coding knowledge and possibly some mathematics or physics. (There are many applications alone where mathematics or physics really isn&#39;t involved, but since I went through both single variable calculus and multivariate calculus, I would want to try to program those in. Otherwise, the majority of it is just memory management, I think.) That&#39;s where I would put in my passion for building something, because that final project involves a whole bunch of components that are supposed to work together so that it turns out to be something useful.
                </div>    
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                   I am not practically sure about software design, because the final code is often totally different than what&#39;s theorized. Even if I were to use some psuedocode and try out different ways to go about solving a problem, it takes a long time to analyze those theoretical algorithms to make sure they work in different circumstances. This is more for safety critical systems, I think, but there are applications of this to building something as well.
                </div>
                <div class="exploreMoreAboutMyselfBottomSpacing">
                    I still somewhat like it, because if I were to consider a software project alone, I need to see how often it is useful for a purpose, or how compatible it would be if I was to build it to different systems such as a Mac or a PlayStation 4.

                   Of course! In addition, since the University of Waterloo is more of an engineering institution, I got this vast network of students to chat with to talk about things I want to build and discover some stuff that I would find interesting or eventually useful for what I want to build.

                   You bet! They are granted to you when you go through the UWaterloo Engineering Orientation Week, which is supposed to spread some awareness to newcomer students about the different facilities and services offered at UWaterloo. These hardhats serve more than just having to protect yourself; they symbolize dedicated hard work to projects, potentially to some leadership and pride.

                    A green hardhat would represent you&#39;re going forward with the committment to leadership and that you&#39;re starting to learn and practice some fundamental engineering skills. A red one shows a more experienced style of leadership, with the ability to recall past previous knowledge to apply it in more complicated tasks in a general sense, symbolizing potential influence with elegant communication. The toughness really comes in when you happen to have a black hardhat; that's where you need to teach those newcomers with very heavy discipline, yet in a way that lets them think UWaterloo is fun in general.

                    That&#39;s something I&#39;m not so particularly sure. I was likely encouraged by the educators from the Services de r&eacute;pit Emergo while I was at Camp Mariste in July 2002, 2003, and 2004 to do some activities that to me personally, I would not want to try out. I did have some successes, but others got myself so nervous that it turned out to be kind of boring for me.

                    For instance, I once tried out indoor climbing inside the back of this auditorium building and I didn&#39;t really want to go so high up because I was scared of heights. Eventually, in November 2015, I went out with some of my classmates to do that at the Grand River Rocks, and to be honest, I did like it, but it sure was kind of painful because I wasn&#39;t used to having my arms carry the most of my weight.

I wish I would be in a video game convention like the Electronic Entertainment Expo.), check out a New Years&#39; festival in person (such as New Years&#39; Eve 2015 in the Nathan Philipps Square), participated in an escape game (February 2016), attended festivals such as the Canada Day Celebrations, held a speech on autism in 2013, tried out a swing ride (known as Vol Ultime in the park, SkyScreamer in SixFlags words) at La Ronde that spins at around 45 mph (70 km/h), and even panelled at the CFES Conference on Diversity in Engineering at the Waterloo Inn in November 2015.

                    Some of these arcade games are very old, at least 20 years old. I still want to play them anyway because with a strong sense of nostalgia, these arcade games are not going to last forever. Some are more modern ones that replicate the kind of feel you get when you played those 3D arcades in the 1990s, but with a more detailed and abstracted point of view. Otherwise, they are there because we are slowly moving into a complete mobile age rather than having to take the cumbersome approach on going somewhere to entertain ourselves.

                    I want to go back to Florida, preferably Daytona Beach Shores for having so many attractions not far away from the calming beaches. I would also take a trip down to NYC, Los Angeles, or Myrtle Beach.

                    Some cities I would want to visit include Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Chicago, Washington DC again, probably Atlanta, Des Moines, and Richmond. If I was to limit my travel to Canada, though, then I would go and check out Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Niagara Falls, Thunder Bay, Winnipeg, and probably Vancouver.

                    It&#39;s more on the basis that I take songs from the radio too seriously; to me, I feel like listening to them makes me feel I won&#39;t have a lot of accomplishment. One example of this would be back in July 2008 where I was with a specialist from a mental rehabilitation centre in Montreal, somewhere in Longueuil, and the song that was playing was 4 Minutes by Madonna. Considering that I really missed out some of my specific friends from high school, it made me feel so personally down that I knew for sure I wasn&#39;t going to get very far with my social and academic progression.

                    Of course I do! Cloud Strife is my favourite protagonist in the entire Final Fantasy series because of his beloved memories that evil lurked his soul out of. Princess Peach and Daisy are far beyond my imagination for having the usual &quot;damsel-in-distress,&quot; especially when dressed up differently in the sports games, preferably golf, basketball, and hockey. When I was a young kid, even though I didn&#39;t really understand her pushy nature, I always loved Misty from the Pok&eacute;mon series mostly because on how she looks with the wink and everything; it really wasn&#39;t Ash Ketchum and the American-dubbed voiceover by Veronica Taylor that made me excited in the anime series.
