The font used for the navigation bar and some of the headers is a replica of the in-game font from the 2015 Wii U game Splatoon, downloadable from http://fizzystack.web.fc2.com/splatoon/en.html. This is a fan-based font created by SquidBoards.com member theFIZZYnator; the font has been produced based on inspection from in-game screenshots with the use of InkScape and FontForge such that some subtle differences are possibly present in the replica. The entire original font is not extracted from the original game, which is forbidden by law.
